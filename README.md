### Registering

<br />

🔵 Accounts are registered and authenticated using Firebase. With Firebase, I am able to use their rules feature to implement server side verification and security. For example, uploaded images have to be a maximum of 1MB, and the password cannot be smaller than 6 characters. Also using rules and Firebase authentication, I can ensure that relevant data is only accessible to the correct user.

<br />

### Adding Users

<img align="center" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72363970/226183035-eb64bc23-df80-4993-a2d1-ecd09bd31472.gif" alt="adding a friend" width="550" height="350">

<br />

🔵 You can send, receive, accept, and decline friend requests. By searching up the user's username, you can send a friend request. The user will see the pending friend requests under their search bar and will be able to accept or decline incoming requests. Once you accept a user's friend request, you are now able to have a chat with them as they are added to your friends list.

### Messaging

🔵 New messages will move the user to the top of your friends list

🔵 You are able to see if the other person has read your message or left you on delivered

🔵 You are able to upload images and open them to view

🔵 Messages are grouped and timestamped
